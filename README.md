# Cash-Cab

The idea of this game is that we play as a cab driver that must drive around the board collecting money bags.

The cab can move in any direction: up, down, left, or right. The cab never stops moving, and the direction the cab travels stays the same unless a key is pressed.

Money bags spawn one at a time, placed randomly on the board for a cab to collect.

When the cab collides with the cash, two things happen:

1) The cash respawns to a new random location on the board
2) The total score increases

If the cab crashes into the wall, the game is over.
